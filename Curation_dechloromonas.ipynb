    "Once biomass reaction and precursors have been fixed we find the model has incorrect energy cycles. These are cycles in which ATP is produced on its own, not as byproduct of any reaction. These incorrect energy cycles are produced because directionality and reaction limits have not been correctly established. As we have already mentioned to establish accurate reaction limits kinetic and labeling experiments need to be performed. However we can theoretically predict reversibility of reactions based on their compoundd. We can automatically calculate the reaction's Gibbs energy and based on it determine whether it is reversible or not. "
