    "Una vez arregladas las reacciones de biomasa nos encontramos con que el modelo tienen ciclos de energía incorrectos, en estos se produce ATP solo lo que es imposible. Los ciclos de energía incorrectos se producen porque la direccionalidad y los límites de las reacciones no se han establecido correctamente. Para estudiar los límites de flujo de cada reaccion habría que acer experimentos de marcaje enn el laboratorio (no hay estudios hechos para dechloromonas aormatica), nos centramos mas en ajustar la reversibilidad de las reacciones. Para ello lo que hacemos es calcular automáticamente su energía libre de gibbs y en base a eso ajustamos si es o no reversible. "
